I'm a tech entrepreneur since more than 2 years now. I try to use the good tools to make my life easier and more productive.
As a photographer, you are facing through the same problems : You don't have enough time to do everything and you have a lot to do.  

With this article, I'd like to share some tools we use a lot in the startup ecosystem that photographers should use as well. 
In fact, independent photographers and entrepreneurs are very similar as they run their own business and they need to find clients, to improve their product and to have all the things done.

# 1. Social 

Social networks are everywhere. Your clients are often on these social networks, so you need to be present here to be found by new clients. 
Regarding your sector, you should probably be present on Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin... **Managing all these networks is very time consuming**, so you need to find the tools to do it easily and effectively. 

  * [Hootsuite][hootsuite]{:target="_blank"}

If you want to manage different social network account, Hootsuite is a great tool to do it quickly and easily. 
You just need to connect your different accounts and then you can **manage all ofthem directly from Hootsuite**. 

You will be able to easily engage with your follower, **schedule post**, manage content through all the different global networks, follow the influencers, follow the mention you could have... 

You don't need to connect to your different social network as you will have all of the them on the same place. That's great right? 

For example on Twitter, you can have a stream with keywords and Hootsuite will show you all the tweet with that keywords at the same place. 

They have a **free plan that allows you to manage up to 3 accounts**. Check it out and you'll see that you will save so much time. 

  * [Buffer][buffer]{:target="_blank"}

![Buffer schedule your posts at the right time on all your social networks](/assets/article_images/2016-09-08/buffer.png)

Buffer is the easiest tool to **publish on the different social networks at the right time**. It allows you to schedule your posts at the perfect timing regarding the activity of your followers.
You can post any content easily as well through an extension. So if you like a website, a quote or whatever, with one click you can share it on your social networks as the right time. 

They base their tool on the scheduling and it is working well. You don't need to take care about the timing anymore :-) Just fill the queue of post you want to share and they'll care about it later. 

It could be a great help to share your photos as they will post it on your different social networks for you.

They have a **free plan** that allows you to connect one account per platform.

  * Crowd Speaking

![The crowd Speaking help you to have a bigger communication campaign](/assets/article_images/2016-09-08/thunderclap.png)

Some time ago we saw the new Crowd Speaking "fashion". You probably already heard about the crowd funding. It's exactly the same but instead of giving money, you give your social reaching. 

The goal is to share the **same message** at **the same time** all together. It's specially great when you want to announce a big news, a competition, a promotion or whatever. 

You just need to create a campaign and then ask your friend to sign up to this campaign. At the end of the campaign, **your message will be share automatically by all of their accounts** and you will reach more people thanks to the crowd. 


[Thunderclap][thunderclap]{:target="_blank"} are the leader and you there is a french company how is doing that as well : [Daycause][daycause]{:target="_blank"}. 

This is a great way to reach more people very easily and very cost effective on the different social media. Have a try and see how your friends/family/followers will help you on that cause :-) You'll see that it could be easier for them to help you by sharing a message automatically than going to Facebook at that time and write a message and share. 

You need to simplify the way they help you. This crowd speaking concept is great as they just need to click on a button and then the message will be shared automatically at the right time.


# 2. How to better manage your emails

The customer relationship is very important. You need to build the trust with your client to let them coming back and buying one more session with you. 
Sometimes, it's really hard to keep in touch with them since we always have a lot of mails and a lot to do so you need to follow up and to send great emails. 

Here are three great tools to manage your discussions on Email and to see if your clients read them. 

  * [Hubspot Sales][sidekick]{:target="_blank"}

![How to know if your recipients readed your emails?](/assets/article_images/2016-09-08/hubspot.png)

Hubspot Sales allows you to **track the emails** you send. They just add a pixel to know if your recipient **open, read and click** on your email. 
You'll say that it is not fair for your recipient, but in fact it is great as you can follow up and they will not miss a great information from you as you will be able to follow up with them.

It is very important to know if they have the information or not otherwise you can wait a very long time before a reply. 

This tool allows you to **schedule your email** as well. This is a very good feature as it's better to send email when your clients are ready to read them than in the middle of the night. So you can write them when you are available and send them at the right time for your client, Excellent right? 

They have a **free account** that allows you to see how is it working. 

  * [Boomerang][boomerang]{:target="_blank"}

![Don't forget to follow up if no reply](/assets/article_images/2016-09-08/boomerang.png)

Another great tool I love called Boomerang. This product allows you to **send you a reminder** if your email is not read or reply. It is especially awesome for the important emails as you will receive a reminder directly on your email account if your recipient didn't open or didn't reply after a certain amount of time. 

You will **never forgot again a follow up** and your recipients will thank you to do these follow up for the important information they missed. 


Boomerang have a **free account** as well to begin with and if you don't have a big email activity, it should be enough. 



  * [Inbox][inbox]{:target="_blank"}

![Spend less time on you emails](/assets/article_images/2016-09-08/inbox.png)


If you are using Gmail, you can either use the classic gmail interface or use Inbox. This is a great new interface that allows you much more than emails. 

It is basically an inbox where you can **organize your conversations** and your **reminders** to spend less time on your emails.
This tool allows you to **snooze some emails and handle them later** by having them back to your inbox when you decide. 
You can close an email conversation as well and it will disappear from your inbox. That means that you will **only see the emails that matters at that time**. 

You can manage your **todo list** directly on your email account and receive reminder in the right time. 

You will no more forgot to reply to an email, and you'll save time as you will no more be disturbed by incoming email as you will be able to snooze them for the right time and you will easily manage your inbox to save time.

I'm using all these tools daily and I hope it will help you to save time to focus on Photography and to be with you family :-)
